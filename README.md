Hey, Hi!
I am a Flutter Developer with 3 years of experience.

In my forst job at Youtility Technologies Pvt. Ltd., I developed a Facility & Secueiry Managenment solution app - Intelliwiz, which gave a lot of features for big companies to run their daily workflows smoothely. The features list is quite facinating, Task management, assset management, site tour, on-prem tour, conveyance, filling up incident reports and site reports, ticket management, work order and work permit, background location tracking for features which required user to work on predefined locations. 
All that made a full-fledged managemnt solution for companies to have everything in their mobiel devices to reduce the hussle bussle.

Along with that I hav also created an Attendance tracking app which helps to capture employee attendance in premises, what made it better was face detection.

Currently, I am working at Pegasus Infocorp Pvt. Ltd., where I am deployed at client location to work on an amazing project.

I am also learning Go(Golang)! Well, it's quite a good start and going good.

Have a good time!!!
